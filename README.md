At an office workplace, there are multiple employees who work in different positions: 
Some of them are salespeople, some of them are office workers and there are group leads too.
- Every employee has a name, a unique identification number, a group, and a monthly salary.
- Salaries are paid once every month. Each position is compensated differently:


  >> Salespeople are making $1750 from commissions on average.
  
  >> Office workers make $1250 if they are a junior employee and $1700 if they are a senior employee.
  
  >> Group leads get a base salary of $1800 plus the number of employees assigned to the same group times $200
  
  >> There are office groups and sales groups, each with a name and an assigned leader.
